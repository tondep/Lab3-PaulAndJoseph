// Exercise 2.2
// Supply additional tests for the constructor here, which
// verify that an exception is thrown when an attempt is made
// to construct an invalid date. Think carefully about which
// invalid dates to test.


// Exercise 2.3
//TEST_CASE("Identical Dates are Equal") {
//    auto date_1 = Date{1, Month::January, 2000};
//    auto date_2 = Date{1, Month::January, 2000};
//
//    CHECK(date_1 == date_2);
//}

// Supply at least three additional tests for
// the equality operator here, to ensure that
// it is working correctly.


// Exercise 2.4
// Provide tests for a new member function of the Date class
// which will increase the date by one day.


// Exercise 2.5
// Write tests for the new default constructor and the
// setDefaultDate method.
